## R Project: Covid-19 Vaccination tracker

This page explains the Covid-19 Vaccination process both in [Sweden](https://github.com/pablo-ferro/Covid_Sweden_vaccination_gganimate) and [Spain](https://github.com/pablo-ferro/Covid_Spain_vaccination_gganimate) and try to set up the comparison structure and formatting for the coming future, as this is a work in progress. Quite fun to tell the story of a project building.

### Introduction

The main goal with this project is to highlight some positive data from this situation and understand the differences between two countries.

Using R for the first time was a challenge that quickly turned into a animated chart to visualize how the rate was trying to reaching the desired 70% of population vaccinated:

How fast vaccination rates grew in such different European countries like Spain and Sweden? And if we look at the two main regions in each country?
