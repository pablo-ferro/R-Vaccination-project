## R Project: Covid-19 Vaccination tracker

This page explains the Covid-19 Vaccination process both in [Sweden](https://github.com/pablo-ferro/Covid_Sweden_vaccination_gganimate) and [Spain](https://github.com/pablo-ferro/Covid_Spain_vaccination_gganimate) and try to set up the comparison structure and formatting for the coming future, as this is a work in progress. Quite fun to tell the story of a project building.

### Introduction
